# Next Steps

In our hello world example we touched upon some very basic and light Aurelia concepts. The most important of those is the view/view-model relationship. However, please note that you can write Aurelia applications in a wide variety of different ways, including custom elements without view-models.

It is highly recommended that you have a read through additional sections in the "Getting Started" section to become familiar with the templating syntax, building components with bindable properties, looping through collections and more.

Once you are familiar with Aurelia's templating syntax and conventions, you will discover that you end up applying these templating basics to every app that you build.
