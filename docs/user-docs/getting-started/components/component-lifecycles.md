# Components Lifecycles

Every component instance has a lifecycle that you can tap into. This makes it easy for you to perform various actions at particular times. For example, you may want to execute some code as soon as your component properties are bound, but before the component is first rendered. Or, you may want to run some code to manipulate the DOM as soon as possible after your element is attached to the document.

Every lifecycle callback is optional. Implement whatever makes sense for your component, but don't feel obligated to implement any of them if they aren't needed for your scenario. Some of the lifecycle callbacks make sense to implement in pairs \(`binding/unbinding`, `attaching/detaching`\) in order to clean up any resources you have allocated. If you register a listener or subscriber in one callback, remember to remove it in the opposite callback.

| Lifecycle Callback | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `constructor` | When the framework instantiates a component, it calls your class's constructor, just like any JavaScript class. This is the best place to put basic initialization code that is not dependent on bindable properties. |
| `define` | The "define" hook is the go-to hook for contextual dynamic composition. It runs just after the constructor and can be treated like a late interceptor for the `@customElement` decorator / `CustomElement.define` api: it allows you to change the `CustomElementDefinition` created by the framework before it is compiled, as well as make certain changes to the controller \(for example, wrapping or overriding the `scope`\). You'll have the compiled definition of the parent \(owning\) element available, as well as any `replace` parts. The returned definition is the cache key for the compiled definition in the context of the parent definition. To make a change only the first time the hook is invoked for an instance underneath a particular parent definition \(affecting all instances of the type underneath that parent definition\), mutate and return the existing definition; to make a contextual change \(that needs to be re-compiled per instance\), clone the definition before mutating and returning it. |
| `hydrating` | The "hydrating" hook allows you to add contextual DI registrations \(to `controller.context`\) to influence which resources are resolved when the template is compiled. It runs synchronously right after the `define` hook and can still be considered part of "construction". From a caching perspective it has a direct 1-1 parity with the `define` hook: the context is cached per unique definition that is returned from `define` \(or per parent definition, if no new definition is returned from `define`\). Therefore, if you need true per-instance contextual registrations \(should be rare\), make sure to bust the cache per instance by returning a clone from the `define` hook. |
| `hydrated` | The "hydrated" hook is a good place to contextually influence the way child components are constructed and rendered. It runs synchronously after the definition is compiled \(which happens synchronously after `hydrating`\) and, like `hydrating`, can still be considered part of "construction" and also has a direct 1-1 parity with the `define` hook from a caching perspective. This is the last opportunity to add DI registrations specifically for child components in this context, or in any other way affect what is rendered and how it is rendered. |
| `created` | The "created" hook is the last hook that can be considered part of "construction". It is called \(synchronously\) after this component is hydrated, which includes resolving, compiling and hydrating child components. In terms of the component hierarchy, the created hooks execute bottom-up, from child to parent \(whereas `define`, `hydrating` and `hydrated` are all top-down\). This is also the last hook that runs only once per instance. Here you can perform any last-minute work that requires having all child components hydrated and that might affect the `bind` and `attach` lifecycles. |
| `binding` | If your component has a method named "binding", then the framework will invoke it after the bindable properties of your component are assigned. In terms of the component hierarchy, the binding hooks execute top-down, from parent to child, so your bindables will have their values set by the owning components, but the bindings in your view are not yet set. This is a good place to perform any work or make changes to anything that your view would depend on because data still flows down synchronously. This is the best time to do anything that might affect children as well. We prefer using this hook over `bound`, unless you specifically need `bound` for a situation when `binding` is too early. You can optionally return a `Promise`. If you do so, it will suspend binding and attaching of the children until the promise resolved. This is useful for fetch/save of data before render. |
| `bound` | If your component has a method named "bound", then the framework will invoke it when the bindings between your component and its view have been set. This is the best place to do anything that requires the values from `let`, `from-view` or `ref` bindings to be set. |
| `attaching` | If your component has a method named "attaching", then the framework will invoke it when it has attached the component's HTML element. You can queue animations and/or initialize certain 3rd party libraries. If you return a `Promise` from this method, it will not suspend binding/attaching of child components but it will be awaited before the `attached` hook is invoked. |
| `attached` | If your component has a method named "attached", then the framework will invoke it when it has attached the current component as well as all of its children. In terms of the component hierarchy, the attached hooks execute bottom-up. This is the best time to invoke code that requires measuring of elements or integrating a 3rd party JavaScript library that requires the whole component subtree to be mounted to the DOM. |
| `detaching` | If your component has a method named "detaching", then the framework will invoke it when it is about to remove your HTML element from the document. In terms of the component hierarchy, the detaching hooks execute bottom-up. If you return a `Promise` \(for example, from an outgoing animation\), it will be awaited before the element is detached. It will run in parallel with promises returned from the `detaching` hooks of siblings / parents. |
| `unbinding` | If your component has a method named "unbinding", then the framework will invoke it when it has fully removed your HTML element from the document. In terms of the component hierarchy, the `unbinding` hooks execute bottom-up. |
| `dispose` | If your component has a method named "dispose", then the framework will invoke it when the component is to be cleared from memory completely. It may be called for example when a component is in a repeater, and some items are removed that are not returned to cache. This is an advanced hook mostly useful for clean up of resources and references that might cause memory leaks if never dereferenced explicitly. |

To tap into any of these hooks, simply implement the method on your class:

{% code title="say-hello.ts" %}
```typescript
import { bindable } from 'aurelia';

export class SayHello {
  @bindable to = 'World';
  message = 'Hello';

  leave() {
    this.message = 'Goodbye';
  }

  detaching() {
    // your special lifecycle-dependent code goes here...
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}
